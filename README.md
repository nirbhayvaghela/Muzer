# **Music Room Dashboard**

Welcome to the **Music Room Dashboard** project! This web application allows users to create personalized dashboards to manage and vote on songs in a group setting. Perfect for physical room parties or online hangouts, users can upvote songs in the queue and decide the order of songs played.

## **Features**

- **Google OAuth Login**: Users can securely log in using their Google account to access the dashboard.
- **User Dashboards**: Each user gets their own personalized dashboard where they can interact with the song queue.
- **Create a Room**: Any user can create a dashboard, which will act as the "host" for the room. The host can share the dashboard URL with others to join.

- **Upvote System**: Room members can upvote songs in the queue. The song with the most upvotes will play next.
